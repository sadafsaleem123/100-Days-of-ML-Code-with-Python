# 100-Days-of-ML-Code-with-Python
This is a repository for my 100 Days of ML Code journey with Bytewise Limited, where I'll be learning and practicing machine learning and data science concepts using Python.  

In this repository, you'll find my daily progress and code snippets for the 100 days of ML Code challenge. Each day, I'll be learning a new concept, building a project or working on a data set using Python. I'll be sharing my code, documentation, and insights on this repository.

- Day-50: Derived the dquation of a Hyperplane in n-dimensions
- Day-56: Practiced a code of hands digit recognizer that uses MLP classifier in Neural Networks.
- Day-57: Staet exploring deep learning and learned about the formulation of its formula and how it works.
- Day-58: Understood different terminologies in Deep Learning including descent gradient, loss function  
- Day-59: Explored more about the Backpropagation technique in Neural Networks.
