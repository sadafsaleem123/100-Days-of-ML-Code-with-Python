In the 4th week of "AI for Everyone," playlist by Andrew Ng, I got an overview of various AI techniques that businesses can use to build AI solutions. Andrew explains the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning, and provides examples of use cases for each technique. He also covers natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and deep learning. He suggests that businesses should consider their specific needs and goals when selecting an AI technique and provides tips for successful implementation. Overall, the video provides a helpful guide for businesses looking to build AI solutions.
